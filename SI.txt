Graphics improvements:
1. Make the invader look more like a spaceship; change the body to an oval with a small circle on top, and make it gray
2. Change the background to black
3. Add stars in the back

Gameplay improvements:
1. Make the ships fall slower and speed up as time goes by
2. Add multiple ships at a time
3. Only allow ships to spawn within a certain x radius of the ship to make it easier
4. have hearts fall that the player can shoot for more lives

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  lives = 3;
  eShipSpeed = 5;
  while (lives > 0){
  eShipSpeed +=.05

Create a loop to spawn new ships

while (lives > 0){

enemyShip.push(new eShip(random((ship.x - (ship.x *2)), ship.x * 2), 0)
}

while(lives > 0 || lives < 3){
  spawn heart at random interval
  if shot increase life count by 1
}
